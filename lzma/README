LZMA (XZ Utils) Build Notes
----------------------------

Home: https://tukaani.org/xz/

Git: git clone https://git.tukaani.org/xz.git

License: mostly public domain (liblzma), some parts GPL or LGPL

Uses Autoconf and Automake, supports vpath and parallel make.

./configure  \
    --prefix=PATH  \
    --enable-shared  \
    --enable-static  \
    --enable-threads=yes
make -j 4
make install

1. Most Linux systems have shared liblzma.so, but many don't have
static liblzma.a, including Cray systems (theta at ANL) that mainly
run static binaries.  The static version is needed for hpclink.

2. The --enable-shared, --enable-static and --enable-threads options
are all enabled by default, but we specify them anyway.

3. The git repo does not contain the autotools-generated files, so
need to run autoreconf in this case.
