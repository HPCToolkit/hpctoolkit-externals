This, the newarch branch of hpctoolkit-externals, is Mark's branch for
updating externals to run on powerpc/le and ARM.  Use this branch with
hpctoolkit's newarch branch.

Note: use devtools's newarch branch for autoreconf on this branch to
keep the autotools revs in sync.

Note: this branch may be unstable at times, and some packages may not
always build cleanly, and there may be some manual steps, especially
for the new platforms.
