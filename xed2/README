License: Intel What If Pre-Release License

As of 2015, XED is now a separate tool, outside of PIN, with a new
license.  The XED license (not PIN) allows redistributing files listed
in 'redist.txt' as part of hpctoolkit + externals, and redist.txt
includes all of XED.

XED is distributed as a binary package.  Tar-copy include and lib
subdirs to the install directory.
