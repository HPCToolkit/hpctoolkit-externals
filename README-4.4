hpctoolkit-externals:  gcc-4.4
-------------------------------

This is the 'gcc-4.4' branch of hpctoolkit-externals.

The current versions of Dyninst and hpctoolkit-externals require GNU
GCC 4.8 or later (and preferably 5.x or later).  As a transition for
old systems with GCC 4.4 (eg, Blue Gene/Q and Red Hat 6.x), if a newer
compiler is not available, then use this branch of externals.

This branch contains a snapshot of the last version of externals that
will build with GCC 4.4.  But you will get better results with Dyninst
and hpcstruct with a newer compiler and externals master.
