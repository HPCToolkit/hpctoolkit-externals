Uses Autoconf and Automake, but git repo does not include
auto-generated files (no autoreconf).  Supports vpath and parallel
make.

./configure  \
    --prefix=PATH  \
    --enable-option ...  \
    CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/lzma/include'  \
    LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/lzma/lib'  \
    LIBS='-llzma'

make -j 4
make install

Now used on all or most platforms.

1. The --enable, --disable options don't really matter, the defaults
are fine.  But we don't use coredump, ptrace or setjmp, so turn them
off.  See: './configure -h'.

2. Libunwind uses liblzma for compressed symbol tables, but does not
have a --with-lzma option.  Need to specify with CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS and
LIBS.

As a side effect of LDFLAGS and LIBS, also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
because autoconf tries to run a compiled file as a test of the C
compiler (unless cross-compiling).

3. Git repo does not include generated files, so when making a tar
file for distfiles, first run autoreconf with the current version of
autotools from hpctoolkit-devtools.  Remove autom4te.cache and be sure
to exclude .git.

autoreconf -f -i
rm -rf autom4te.cache
tar cf libunwind-date.tar --exclude .git libunwind
bzip2 libunwind-date.tar

The libunwind-2017-10-02 tar file is from commit 60ddc67196ea.
The libunwind-2017-07-19 tar file is from commit 93f319466f3d.
